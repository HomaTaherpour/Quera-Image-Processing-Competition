A publisher works with 5 authors. He has recently received new texts from these authors. But due to distraction, he has forgotten which author each text belongs to. He decided to use his machine learning knowledge to find the author of each text. For this, he has produced a training dataset, each line of which corresponds to one of the previous texts of each author. This set has 381 columns, one column indicates the author and the other columns indicate whether a particular word is present in the text or not.

You need to help this publisher train a model to predict the author by receiving information about the presence or absence of these words in a text.
