A store has designed a surveillance system that performs a detailed analysis of customers using cameras. This system should use the images of people's faces, age group and gender to personalize each person's purchase. For this purpose, a set of faces and their associated features are used.

Our goal in this project is to design a model that recognizes the age group and gender of people using their faces.
